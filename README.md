## 📌 MAIN DESCRIPTION

### ✅ Object-Oriented Functions
🔹 Each field has a separate object-oriented function, ensuring modularity, code reusability, and maintainability.

### ✅ Modular Design
🔹 The script is modular, making it easy to maintain, structured, and flexible for creating test scenarios.

### ✅ Folder Separation
🔹 Functions and fields are well-organized in separate files, categorized into folders based on software sections for clear navigation.

## 📚 Libraries & Dependencies

### 🔹 Built-in Python Libraries
- ✔️ `os` – File and directory operations
- ✔️ `json` – Handling JSON data structures
- ✔️ `csv` – Working with CSV files
- ✔️ `datetime` – Date and time manipulation
- ✔️ `time` – Execution time measurement & delays
- ✔️ `inspect` – Object and function introspection
- ✔️ `re` – Regular expression processing
- ✔️ `string` – String manipulation utilities
- ✔️ `random` – Random number and data generation
- ✔️ `collections.OrderedDict` – Maintaining order of dictionary keys
- ✔️ `ActionChains` – Automating complex interactions in Selenium

### 🔹 Selenium Modules
- ✔️ `By` – Element locators (`By.ID`, `By.XPATH`, `By.CLASS_NAME`, etc.)
- ✔️ `WebDriverWait` – Explicit waits for better element handling
- ✔️ `EC (Expected Conditions)` – Wait conditions like `EC.presence_of_element_located()`
- ✔️ `Exceptions` – Selenium-specific error handling
- ✔️ `Selenium-Wire` – Capturing and intercepting network requests

## ⚙️ MAIN FEATURES

### ✅ Error Handling & Debugging
- 🔹 **Try-Except Blocks** – Ensures robust error handling, preventing script crashes and allowing debugging.
- 🔹 **Print Statements** – Clearly defined console outputs for better tracking, debugging, and understanding script execution flow.
- 🔹 **Logging System** – Captures and logs important events, errors, and execution details for debugging and reporting.
- 🔹 **Exception Handling** – Custom exception handling ensures smooth execution and clear debugging messages.

### ✅ Automation & Testing
- 🔹 **Explicit and Implicit Waits** – Ensures elements load before interaction, improving stability and reliability.
- 🔹 **GraphQL and Query Interception** – Validates backend API calls.
- 🔹 **Post Request & Status Code Validation** – Verifies server responses.
- 🔹 **Console Log Capturing** – Intercepts browser console logs, including errors, warnings, and JavaScript objects.
- 🔹 **Screenshot Capture** – Takes screenshots after each step for debugging.

### ✅ Performance & Compatibility
- 🔹 **Timer Measurement** – Tracks execution time per step and calculates the total script execution duration.
- 🔹 **Cross-Browser Testing** – Supports Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
- 🔹 **Headless Mode** – Runs tests without UI rendering for efficiency.
- 🔹 **Cache Cleanup** – Clears stored browser cache and cookies for a fresh test environment.
